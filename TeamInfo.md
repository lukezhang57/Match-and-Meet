## Project Summary

Our project is a web app that will allow students at the U of I to connect and make friends with other students depending on what criteria they’re looking for, such as common interests, background, major, and shared classes. We hope to make meeting new people easier for students by providing them a list of people who could be compatible with them through a seamless experience in our app. This can save time for them because it bypasses the need to constantly browse for group chats, discord servers, reddit threads to connect with people from RSOs, certain interest groups, or from a certain major.

To achieve this, we will use a database that will store the basic information of students which includes the full name, major, and residence. Students will then be able to input their interests, RSOs, and major upon account creation, and this will be the basis used for gathering potential ‘matches’ for them. For testing purposes, the data will be automatically generated using a script, which will be explained later in the document. Students will have two options to find matches within our app: they can find other students based on a percentage of common interests, or they can also select certain preferences (like being a CS major or someone living in IKE) that they’re looking for in other students and filter matches based on those constraints.
